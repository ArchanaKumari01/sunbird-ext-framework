    <p>In 2000, ten years later, the international community met again at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, an event
      which drew 1100 participants.</p>
    <p>The forum took stock of the fact that many countries were far from having reached the goals established at the World
      Conference on Education for All in 1990.</p>
    <p>The participants agreed on the Dakar Framework for Action which re-affirmed their commitment to achieving Education for
      All by the year 2015, and identified six key measurable education goals which aim to meet the learning needs of all
      children, youth and adults by 2015.</p>
